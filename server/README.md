# Redis Browser - Server

## Run Locally

1. Make sure you have a Redis server running on port 6379 with default settings (i.e. no password)
1. Run main class `com.davidagood.RedisBrowserServerApplication`
1. Or run `../gradlew bootRun`

**Note:** The dependency `redis-client` has been added directly to this 
repo as a stop-gap solution since it has not yet been published to any 
public repository. That project lives 
[here](https://github.com/paltamadura/redis-client).
